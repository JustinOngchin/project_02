## Graph 1: US Population vs. Global Population [(Source 1)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jarredpriester/global-population?resource=download) [(Source 2)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/POPTOTUSA647NWDB)
![Population Comparison](Population.png)
This linear graph compares the populations of the US and global from 1960 to 2020. While the US population grows steadily during these years, the global population has a steeper trajectory, demonstrating faster growth. This makes sense: the global population incorporates the exponential growth of all countries, while the United States is confined to a single population. 

## Graph 2: Pokemon Count [(Data Source)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json)
![Pokemon Comparison](Pokemon.png)
This bar graph conveys what the aggregate quantity is of 3 main types of pokemon: grass, fire, and water. Furthermore, the graph demonstrates that of these three pokemon types, the water pokemon has the largest number (just over 30), while the fire pokemon has the smallest number (approx. 13), with the grass pokemon having only a slightly higher number than fire pokemon.
